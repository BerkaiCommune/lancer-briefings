Trenventari, Qada // 1260 p.c 3rd month of Summer// Duncan's Lie

Duncan stands atop a dais and points to the 5 that stand accused. These 5 cooperated to plan an assassination attempt on my life. They sought to kill me in my sleep, and to undo all that I have done for this grand city. They seek the demise of Qada, they seek to overthrow that which we have here in Qada. They would have us live in a filthy city, in a city without our university, our merchants, our technology. They do not want you and I to succeed, they want us to fail. They do not care for the great dream of Trenventari, of Qada. They care for only themselves. Thus we shall give them what they want, we shall free them from their burdens here in Qada. They are exiled to the far reaches of trenventari, while this may seem dangerous, I assure you they will not pose a threat to you the citizenry. For they shall be marked and barred from entering this fair city ever again.

The five that stood atop the dais with him, were then marked by magic branding on their right upper shoulder for all to see. They were then guided to a carriage and escorted out of town, heading north to Erta.
